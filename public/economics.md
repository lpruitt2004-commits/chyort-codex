- **Marxist Economics:** Karl Marx’s critique of capitalism, labor theory of value
- **Neoclassical Economics:** Marginalism, mathematical modeling, equilibrium theory
- **Keynesian Revolution (20th c.):** John Maynard Keynes, government intervention, macroeconomic stabilization
- **Modern Developments:** Monetarism (Friedman), behavioral economics, globalization, digital economy

### Core Economic Concepts

- **Scarcity & Opportunity Cost**: Resources are limited; every choice means giving up alternatives; foundational economic concept
- **Supply & Demand**: Price determined by quantity available and quantity desired; market equilibrium; elasticity measures sensitivity
- **Market Structures**: Perfect competition (many firms, low barriers), monopolistic competition (differentiated products), oligopoly (few firms), monopoly (one firm)
- **Elasticity**: Measures responsiveness (price elasticity of demand, income elasticity); informs pricing and policy
- **Consumer & Producer Surplus**: Benefit from transactions; consumers pay less than willing to pay, producers receive more than minimum acceptable

### Microeconomics vs. Macroeconomics

- **Microeconomics**: Individual actors (consumers, firms), markets for specific goods, price determination, consumer behavior, firm production decisions
- **Macroeconomics**: Economy-wide phenomena (GDP, inflation, unemployment), aggregate demand/supply, growth rates, monetary and fiscal policy
- **GDP (Gross Domestic Product)**: Total monetary value of goods and services produced; measure of economic output
- **Inflation**: Rising general price levels; affects purchasing power, savings, interest rates
- **Unemployment**: People willing to work but unable to find jobs; cyclical (recessions), structural (job skills mismatch), frictional (job search)

### Economic Systems & Theories

- **Capitalism**: Private ownership, market-driven, profit motive; risk and reward for entrepreneurs
- **Socialism**: Collective/state ownership, production for need; equity focus
- **Mixed Economy**: Combination of market and government regulation; most modern economies
- **Keynesian Economics**: Government intervention during recessions; aggregate demand matters
- **Classical Economics**: Markets self-correct; supply creates demand; minimal government intervention
- **Modern Monetarism**: Money supply affects economy; inflation control priority

### International & Development Economics

- **Comparative Advantage**: Countries specialize in what they produce efficiently; mutually beneficial trade
- **Exchange Rates**: Value of one currency relative to another; affects trade competitiveness
- **Trade Barriers**: Tariffs (taxes on imports), quotas (quantity limits), protectionism vs. free trade debate
- **Globalization**: Increased international trade, capital flows, labor mobility; benefits and challenges
- **Development Economics**: Poverty reduction, economic growth in developing nations, income inequality, investment in human capital

### Financial Concepts

- **Interest Rates**: Cost of borrowing; determined by supply/demand for money and central bank policy; affects investments and savings
- **Stock Market**: Ownership shares in companies; price reflects investor expectations; source of capital for firms
- **Bonds**: Debt instruments; government or corporate; fixed income investments
- **Inflation vs. Deflation**: Rising (inflation) or falling (deflation) price levels; inflation moderate level normal, deflation problematic
- **Financial Crisis**: System instability; bank failures, asset bubbles, credit crunches; 2008 financial crisis example

### Behavioral Economics

- **Cognitive Biases**: Loss aversion (fear of loss stronger than hope of gain), anchoring (first number influences estimates), herd behavior
- **Rationality**: Humans often irrational; emotions, social influences affect decisions; differs from classical economics assumptions
- **Nudges**: Small policy changes that influence behavior; choice architecture
- **Behavioral Finance**: Investor psychology, bubbles, market anomalies

### Great Economists & Theories

- **Adam Smith**: Invisible hand, free markets, division of labor, wealth of nations
- **David Ricardo**: Comparative advantage in trade, rent theory
- **John Maynard Keynes**: Macroeconomic theory, counter-cyclical policy, demand matters
- **Milton Friedman**: Monetarism, free market advocate, inflation and unemployment relationship
- **Paul Samuelson**: Unified micro and macro economics, mathematical approach
- **Thomas Piketty**: Inequality research, capital in the 21st century
- **Richard Thaler**: Behavioral economics, nudges, Nobel Prize 2017

### Skills & Resources

- **Essential Skills**: Analytical thinking, mathematics (calculus, statistics), critical analysis of assumptions, understanding context and history
- **Learning Paths**: Economics degrees (BA/MA), online courses (Coursera, edX), reading economics literature and news analysis
- **Tools**: Econometric software (Stata, R, Python), data sources (World Bank, OECD, national statistics), spreadsheet modeling
