# Philosophy

Philosophy is the study of fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language.

### Core Philosophical Branches

- **Metaphysics**: What is real? Studies reality, existence, being, causation, time, space, substance. Questions like "What is consciousness?" and "Does free will exist?"
- **Epistemology**: What can we know? Examines belief, truth, justification, and the limits of human knowledge. Debates between skepticism, rationalism, and empiricism
- **Ethics**: How should we live? Explores morality, right and wrong, virtue, duty, happiness. Ethical frameworks include consequentialism, deontology, virtue ethics
- **Logic**: How do we reason? Studies valid argumentation, fallacies, and critical thinking. The foundation for all philosophical inquiry
- **Political Philosophy**: What is justice? Examines rights, government legitimacy, freedom, equality, social contracts. Influences legal and political systems
- **Philosophy of Mind**: What is consciousness? Studies mental states, identity, the mind-body problem, artificial intelligence, qualia
