# Physics

Physics is the study of the fundamental laws of nature, motion, energy, and the universe—from subatomic particles to galaxies.

## History

- **Ancient Era:** Early observations of the heavens, simple machines, and natural phenomena by Greek, Indian, and Chinese philosophers.
- **Classical Physics (17th–19th c.):** Isaac Newton formulates laws of motion and gravity; development of thermodynamics, electromagnetism (Faraday, Maxwell), and optics.
- **Modern Physics (20th c.):** Einstein’s relativity, quantum mechanics (Planck, Bohr, Heisenberg), nuclear physics, and the Standard Model of particle physics.
- **Contemporary Physics:** Advances in cosmology, quantum computing, gravitational waves, dark matter/energy, and unification theories.

## Notable Figures

- **Isaac Newton:** Laws of motion and gravity; calculus.
- **James Clerk Maxwell:** Unified electricity and magnetism.
- **Albert Einstein:** Special and general relativity.
- **Marie Curie:** Pioneered radioactivity research.
- **Niels Bohr:** Quantum theory of the atom.
- **Richard Feynman:** Quantum electrodynamics, science communication.
- **Stephen Hawking:** Black holes, cosmology.

## Timeline

- **1687:** Newton publishes "Principia Mathematica."
- **1865:** Maxwell’s equations unify electromagnetism.
- **1905:** Einstein’s special relativity.
- **1915:** Einstein’s general relativity.
- **1927:** Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.
- **1964:** Discovery of cosmic microwave background.
- **2012:** Higgs boson discovered at CERN.

## Case Study: The Photoelectric Effect

Einstein explained how light can eject electrons from metal, showing that light behaves as both a wave and a particle. This discovery was pivotal for quantum mechanics and earned him the Nobel Prize in 1921.
