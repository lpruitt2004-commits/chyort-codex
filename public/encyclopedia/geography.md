# Geography

Geography is the study of Earth's landscapes, environments, peoples, and places. It bridges natural and human sciences, helping us understand spatial relationships and global challenges.

## History & Evolution

- **Ancient Geography:** Eratosthenes calculates Earth's circumference, Ptolemy’s maps
- **Medieval:** Islamic geographers, Silk Road mapping, Chinese exploration
- **Age of Exploration:** Columbus, Magellan, global navigation
- **Modern:** GIS, satellite imagery, globalization, climate science

## Notable Geographers & Biographies

- **Eratosthenes (276–194 BCE):** Calculated Earth’s circumference
- **Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859):** Founder of modern geography, biogeography
- **Carl Ritter (1779–1859):** Systematic study of places, geographic education
- **Ellen Churchill Semple (1863–1932):** Environmental determinism, American geography
- **Yi-Fu Tuan (b. 1930):** Humanistic geography, sense of place

## Timeline of Major Developments

- **~250 BCE:** Eratosthenes measures Earth
- **150 CE:** Ptolemy’s "Geographia"
- **1492–1522:** Columbus and Magellan’s voyages
- **1960s:** Satellite imagery, remote sensing
- **1990s:** GIS revolution

## Case Study: The Dust Bowl

In the 1930s, poor land management and drought led to the Dust Bowl in the US Great Plains. Geography helped explain the causes and guide recovery, influencing soil conservation and land use policy.

## Knowledge Base

### Physical Geography

- **Landforms**: Mountains (formation, erosion), valleys, plains, deserts, plateaus; processes that shape landscapes
- **Climate Systems**: Temperature, precipitation, wind patterns; climate zones (tropical, temperate, polar, desert)
- **Ecosystems & Biomes**: Rainforests (biodiversity), grasslands, tundra, coral reefs; energy flow, species adaptation
- **Hydrology**: Water cycle, rivers, oceans, groundwater; watershed management, water resources
- **Plate Tectonics**: Continental drift, earthquakes, volcanoes; geological hazards and island formation
- **Weathering & Erosion**: How rocks break down, soil formation, mass movement (landslides), coastal erosion

### Human Geography

- **Population**: Demographics (age, sex ratio), growth rates, population density, migration patterns
- **Culture**: Languages, religions, customs, traditions, cultural diffusion; how culture varies by place
- **Urbanization**: City growth, urban sprawl, megacities, urban planning, quality of life in cities
- **Migration**: Why people move (economic, political, environmental), refugee crises, diaspora communities
- **Development**: Economic inequality, standard of living, infrastructure, access to resources
- **Political Geography**: Borders, territories, nation-states, geopolitical conflicts, sovereignty

### Specialized Geography Fields

- **Urban Geography**: City development, gentrification, informal settlements, transportation, livability
- **Economic Geography**: Resource distribution, trade patterns, globalization, supply chains, economic inequality
- **Political Geography**: Geopolitics, territorial disputes, borders, international relations
- **Cultural Geography**: Ethnic diversity, language distribution, religious landscapes, cultural identity
- **Environmental Geography**: Conservation, sustainability, climate change, environmental justice, pollution
- **Medical Geography**: Disease distribution, health access, pandemics, environmental health

### Tools & Technologies

- **Cartography**: Map-making, map projections, symbolization, representing 3D world on 2D surface
- **GIS (Geographic Information Systems)**: Digital mapping, spatial analysis, data visualization, remote sensing interpretation
- **Remote Sensing**: Satellite imagery, aerial photography, data collection from distance
- **GPS**: Navigation, location tracking, surveying, precision mapping
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical methods, pattern recognition, modeling geographic phenomena

### Great Geographers & Concepts

- **Eratosthenes**: Calculated Earth's circumference; ancient Greek geographer
- **Alexander von Humboldt**: Modern geography founder; biodiversity, climatic zones, human-environment interaction
- **Carl Ritter**: Geographic education, systematic study of places
- **Ellen Churchill Semple**: Influence of geographic environment on human development
- **Yi-Fu Tuan**: Humanistic geography, sense of place, emotional geography
- **Doreen Massey**: Space and place theory; geography of identity and power

### Major Geographical Questions

- **Physical**: How do landforms form? What causes earthquakes? How does climate change affect ecosystems?
- **Human**: Why do people migrate? How do cultures differ? What causes economic inequality?
- **Integrated**: How do humans modify environments? How do environmental changes affect societies? Can development be sustainable?

### Skills & Resources

- **Essential Skills**: Observation, map reading, data analysis, understanding scales (local to global), systemic thinking
- **Learning Paths**: Geography courses and degrees, field work and travel, GIS certification, environmental science background
- **Tools**: Maps, GIS software (ArcGIS, QGIS), satellite imagery, census data, statistical software
- **Career Prep**: GIS skills highly valuable, understanding environmental and social issues important, cultural sensitivity
