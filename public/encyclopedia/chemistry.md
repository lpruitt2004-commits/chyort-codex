# Chemistry

Chemistry is the science of matter, its properties, structure, composition, and the changes it undergoes. It connects physics, biology, geology, and materials science, and is central to understanding the world at the molecular level.

## History & Evolution

- **Ancient Chemistry:** Early metallurgy, alchemy in Egypt, China, and the Islamic world
- **17th–18th Centuries:** Birth of modern chemistry, Boyle’s gas laws, Lavoisier’s conservation of mass
- **19th Century:** Mendeleev’s periodic table, atomic theory, organic chemistry foundations
- **20th Century:** Discovery of radioactivity (Curie), quantum chemistry, polymers, DNA structure
- **21st Century:** Nanotechnology, green chemistry, computational chemistry, CRISPR gene editing

## Notable Chemists & Biographies

- **Antoine Lavoisier (1743–1794):** Founder of modern chemistry, law of conservation of mass
- **Dmitri Mendeleev (1834–1907):** Creator of the periodic table, predicted new elements
- **Marie Curie (1867–1934):** Pioneer of radioactivity, first woman to win a Nobel Prize
- **Linus Pauling (1901–1994):** Chemical bonding, molecular biology, peace activism
- **Ahmed Zewail (1946–2016):** Femtochemistry, Nobel laureate for observing chemical reactions in real time

## Timeline of Major Discoveries

- **~3000 BCE:** Early metallurgy (copper, bronze)
- **1661:** Boyle’s "The Sceptical Chymist"
- **1789:** Lavoisier’s "Elementary Treatise of Chemistry"
- **1869:** Mendeleev’s periodic table

- **1953:** DNA structure (Watson, Crick, Franklin, Wilkins)
- **2000s:** Rise of nanotechnology and green chemistry

## Case Study: The Discovery of DNA Structure

In 1953, James Watson, Francis Crick, Rosalind Franklin, and Maurice Wilkins determined the double-helix structure of DNA. This discovery revolutionized biology, medicine, and chemistry, enabling the rise of molecular genetics and biotechnology.

### Core Concepts

- **Atomic Structure**: Protons (positive), neutrons (neutral), electrons (negative), atomic number and mass, isotopes and nuclear stability
- **Chemical Bonding**: Ionic bonds (electron transfer), covalent bonds (electron sharing), metallic bonds (electron sea), intermolecular forces (van der Waals, hydrogen bonds)
- **Reactions**: Synthesis (combining), decomposition (breaking apart), combustion (burning), redox (electron transfer), rates and catalysts
- **Organic Chemistry**: Carbon compounds, hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, alkynes), functional groups (alcohols, aldehydes, carboxylic acids), polymers and plastics
