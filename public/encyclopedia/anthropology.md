# Anthropology

Anthropology is the study of humans, past and present. It explores human evolution, culture, language, and societies. Major branches include cultural anthropology, archaeology, biological anthropology, and linguistic anthropology. Anthropologists seek to understand human diversity and commonality.

## History

- **Ancient Roots:** Early curiosity about human origins, myths, and customs in ancient Greece, China, and the Middle East.
- **19th Century:** Anthropology emerges as a formal discipline; early ethnographic studies, colonial encounters, and the development of evolutionary theories (e.g., Lewis Henry Morgan, Edward Tylor).
- **20th Century:** Franz Boas introduces cultural relativism; fieldwork becomes central; rise of structuralism, functionalism, symbolic anthropology.
- **Contemporary:** Focus on globalization, identity, power, gender, and applied anthropology; interdisciplinary approaches.
