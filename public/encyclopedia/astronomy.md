# Astronomy

## Major Subfields

- **Astrophysics:** The study of the physical properties and processes of celestial objects and phenomena.
- **Cosmology:** The study of the origin, evolution, and fate of the universe.
- **Planetary Science:** The study of planets, moons, and planetary systems.
- **Stellar Astronomy:** The study of stars, their life cycles, and their properties.
- **Galactic and Extragalactic Astronomy:** The study of galaxies, including our own Milky Way, and the universe beyond.
- **Radio, Optical, and X-ray Astronomy:** The study of the universe using different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation.

## Notable Astronomers

- **Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543):** Proposed the heliocentric model of the solar system.
- **Galileo Galilei (1564–1642):** Used telescopes to observe moons of Jupiter and phases of Venus.
- **Edwin Hubble (1889–1953):** Discovered the expansion of the universe.
- **Vera Rubin (1928–2016):** Provided evidence for dark matter through galaxy rotation curves.
- **Carl Sagan (1934–1996):** Popularized astronomy and planetary science.

## Timeline of Key Discoveries

- **~1600 BCE:** Babylonian astronomers record planetary motions.
- **1543:** Copernicus publishes heliocentric theory.
- **1609:** Galileo uses telescope for astronomical observations.
- **1929:** Hubble discovers universe expansion.
- **1965:** Discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation.
- **1995:** First exoplanet orbiting a sun-like star discovered.
- **2019:** First image of a black hole captured by the Event Horizon Telescope.

## Case Study: The Hubble Space Telescope

Launched in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope has revolutionized our understanding of the universe. It has provided deep field images, measured the rate of expansion, and observed distant galaxies, nebulae, and exoplanets.
