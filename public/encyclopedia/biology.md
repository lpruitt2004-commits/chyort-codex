# Biology

Biology is the scientific study of life and living organisms, from the molecular machinery inside cells to the complexity of ecosystems. It seeks to understand the structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, and distribution of living things.

## History & Evolution

- **Ancient Biology:** Early herbalism, animal domestication, Aristotle’s classification of living things
- **Medieval Biology:** Islamic Golden Age scholars (Al-Jahiz, Avicenna), medieval bestiaries
- **Renaissance:** Microscope invention (Hooke, Leeuwenhoek), anatomical studies (Vesalius)
- **19th Century:** Darwin’s theory of evolution, Mendel’s genetics, Pasteur’s germ theory
- **20th Century:** Discovery of DNA structure, rise of molecular biology, Human Genome Project
- **21st Century:** CRISPR gene editing, synthetic biology, systems biology, astrobiology

## Notable Biologists & Biographies

- **Aristotle (384–322 BCE):** Early classification of animals, founder of zoology
- **Charles Darwin (1809–1882):** Theory of evolution by natural selection
- **Gregor Mendel (1822–1884):** Father of genetics, pea plant experiments
- **Louis Pasteur (1822–1895):** Germ theory, pasteurization, vaccines
- **Rosalind Franklin (1920–1958):** X-ray crystallography, DNA structure
- **Jane Goodall (b. 1934):** Primate behavior, conservation

## Timeline of Major Discoveries

- **~350 BCE:** Aristotle’s classification of animals
- **1665:** Hooke observes cells in cork
- **1859:** Darwin publishes "On the Origin of Species"
- **1866:** Mendel’s laws of inheritance
- **1953:** Watson, Crick, Franklin, and Wilkins describe DNA structure
- **2003:** Completion of the Human Genome Project

## Case Study: The Human Genome Project

Launched in 1990 and completed in 2003, the Human Genome Project mapped all the genes in human DNA. It revolutionized medicine, genetics, and our understanding of human evolution and disease.

### Core Concepts

- **Cell Biology**: Cell structure and function (nucleus, mitochondria, organelles), cellular processes (photosynthesis, cellular respiration), cell division (mitosis, meiosis), cell communication
- **Genetics**: DNA structure and function, RNA and protein synthesis, heredity and inheritance patterns, gene expression and regulation, mutations and genetic variation
- **Evolution**: Natural selection (survival of the fittest), adaptation and speciation, evidence for evolution (fossil record, DNA), evolutionary tree of life, microevolution vs. macroevolution
- **Ecology**: Ecosystems and biomes, food chains and energy flow, predator-prey relationships, biodiversity and extinction, population dynamics, conservation biology
- **Anatomy & Physiology**: Human body systems (nervous, circulatory, respiratory, digestive, immune), organ function, homeostasis, disease and adaptation

### Major Biological Concepts

- **Photosynthesis**: Plants convert sunlight to chemical energy (glucose); foundation of most food chains
- **Cellular Respiration**: Cells break down glucose for ATP energy; aerobic (with oxygen) and anaerobic pathways
- **DNA Replication**: Genetic information copied accurately for cell division; errors create mutations
- **Natural Selection**: Environmental pressures favor beneficial traits; over time, species adapt or go extinct
- **Homeostasis**: Living things maintain stable internal conditions (temperature, pH, water balance) despite external changes

### The Tree of Life

- **Domain Bacteria**: Single-celled prokaryotes, found everywhere, including symbiotic and pathogenic species
- **Domain Archaea**: Prokaryotes often in extreme environments; distinct from bacteria genetically
- **Domain Eukarya**: Organisms with nucleus and organelles; includes protists, fungi, plants, animals
- **Kingdoms**: Animalia (multicellular, mobile), Plantae (autotrophic, photosynthesis), Fungi (decomposers), Protista (diverse unicellular)
