# Gardening

Gardening is the art and science of cultivating plants for food, beauty, and well-being. It connects people to nature, supports biodiversity, and has been practiced for thousands of years across cultures.

## History & Evolution

- **Ancient Gardens:** Mesopotamian and Egyptian gardens, Hanging Gardens of Babylon, Chinese scholar gardens
- **Medieval:** Monastic herb gardens, Islamic paradise gardens, European kitchen gardens
- **Renaissance:** Ornamental gardens, Italian villas, French formal gardens (Versailles)
- **Modern:** Allotment gardens, community gardens, organic and permaculture movements

## Notable Gardeners & Innovators

- **Gertrude Jekyll (1843–1932):** English garden designer, color theory in planting
- **Lancelot "Capability" Brown (1716–1783):** English landscape architect, naturalistic style
- **Masaru Emoto (1943–2014):** Japanese researcher, water and plant consciousness
- **Alice Waters (b. 1944):** Edible Schoolyard Project, organic gardening advocate

## Timeline of Major Developments

- **~10,000 BCE:** First evidence of agriculture and gardening
- **600 BCE:** Hanging Gardens of Babylon
- **1600s:** Formal gardens in Europe
- **1800s:** Rise of public parks and botanical gardens
- **1970s:** Organic gardening and permaculture

## Case Study: The Victory Gardens

During World Wars I and II, millions of people in the US and UK grew "Victory Gardens" to supplement food supplies. These home and community gardens boosted morale, nutrition, and self-sufficiency.

## Knowledge Base

### Core Concepts

- **Soil Science**: pH levels (acidic, neutral, alkaline), nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium), composting and organic matter, soil amendments and testing
- **Plant Biology**: Growth cycles (germination, vegetative, flowering, dormancy), photosynthesis and energy production, propagation methods (seeds, cuttings, layering)
- **Pest Management**: Organic methods (companion planting, beneficial insects), integrated pest control (IPM), natural pest deterrents, disease prevention
- **Garden Design**: Layout and space planning, companion planting (which plants help each other), color and texture combinations, focal points and hardscaping
- **Vegetable Gardening**: Crop rotation (changing plant families by season), succession planting for continuous harvest, harvesting timing and preservation (canning, freezing)
- **Sustainable Practices**: Water conservation and drip irrigation, native plants for local ecosystems, permaculture and regenerative methods, reducing chemical inputs

### Gardening Types & Styles

- **Vegetable Garden**: Food production, raised beds or in-ground, seasonal varieties, seed selection matters
- **Flower Garden**: Ornamental plants, annuals vs. perennials, cutting gardens for arrangements, pollinator gardens
- **Container Gardening**: Growing in pots and planters, good for limited space, portable, easier maintenance for some
- **Herb Garden**: Culinary and medicinal herbs, very productive in small spaces, mostly perennial in mild climates
- **Fruit Garden**: Trees (apples, peaches, citrus), shrubs (berries), requires patience but rewarding
- **Native Plant Garden**: Local species, drought-tolerant, supports local wildlife, low maintenance once established
- **Community/Urban Garden**: Shared spaces in cities, growing food in small plots, social aspect and food security
- **Permaculture**: Mimics natural ecosystems, polyculture (many species), long-term sustainability, reduced work over time

### Seasonal Gardening Guide

- **Spring**: Start seeds indoors, prepare soil, plant cool-season crops, prune early bloomers
- **Summer**: Water regularly, harvest frequently, deadhead flowers, plant heat-loving crops
- **Fall**: Plant garlic and root vegetables, extend season with cold frames, collect seeds
- **Winter**: Plan next year's garden, maintain tools, protect perennials, study and rest

### Essential Skills & Knowledge

- **Plant Identification**: Know your plants, their needs, growth habits, companion and incompatible plants
- **Soil Assessment**: Test soil pH, nutrient content, drainage, texture; amend accordingly
- **Timing**: Know frost dates, planting schedules, harvest windows for your climate zone
- **Problem-Solving**: Diagnose plant diseases, pest issues, nutrient deficiencies; adjust practices
- **Patience & Observation**: Gardening is learning by doing; keep notes on what works in your specific garden

### Tools & Resources

- **Essential Tools**: Hand trowel, spade, rake, hoe, pruners, garden gloves, watering can or hose
- **Learning Resources**: Local cooperative extension, gardening books and blogs, seed catalogs, gardening communities
- **Starting Out**: Begin small, learn your climate zone, start with easy plants (tomatoes, basil, zucchini)

### Fields of Work

- **Horticulturist**: Cultivate plants professionally, manage gardens and nurseries, plant breeding and selection
- **Landscape Designer**: Plan and design outdoor spaces for residential and commercial projects; combines aesthetics with function
- **Arborist**: Care for trees professionally, pruning, tree health assessment, disease treatment
- **Urban Farmer**: Grow food in city environments, use vertical gardening, rooftops, community spaces
- **Greenhouse Manager**: Oversee plant production facilities, manage climate and growing conditions, efficiency and profitability
- **Gardening Consultant**: Advise homeowners and businesses on garden planning, maintenance, problem-solving
- **Botanical Garden Curator**: Manage plant collections, lead conservation efforts, educate the public
- **Agricultural Extension Agent**: Educate communities on gardening and farming practices, research application
