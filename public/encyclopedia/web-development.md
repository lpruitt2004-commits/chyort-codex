# Web Development

Web development is the creation and maintenance of websites and web applications. It encompasses frontend and backend technologies, design, security, and performance, and evolves rapidly to shape how people interact, learn, and do business online.

## History

- **1990s:** Tim Berners-Lee invents the World Wide Web. Early sites are static, using HTML.
- **2000s:** CSS and JavaScript enable dynamic, styled pages. Rise of blogs, e-commerce, and server-side scripting (PHP, ASP.NET).
- **2010s:** Mobile-first design, responsive layouts, and JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular, Vue). APIs, cloud hosting, DevOps.
- **2020s:** Jamstack, serverless, edge computing, AI-powered web apps, WebAssembly, PWAs, real-time collaboration.

## Notable Figures

- **Tim Berners-Lee:** Inventor of the Web.
- **Brendan Eich:** Creator of JavaScript.
- **Håkon Wium Lie:** Creator of CSS.
- **Matt Mullenweg:** Co-founder of WordPress.
- **Evan You:** Creator of Vue.js.
- **Jordan Walke:** Creator of React.

## Timeline

- **1991:** First website goes live.
- **1995:** JavaScript introduced.
- **2004:** Web 2.0 era begins (social media, interactivity).
- **2013:** React.js released.
- **2015:** Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) concept introduced.
- **2020:** Widespread adoption of serverless and Jamstack.

## Case Study: React.js

React, developed by Facebook, revolutionized frontend development with its component-based architecture and virtual DOM. It powers major sites like Facebook, Instagram, and Airbnb, and inspired other frameworks.
