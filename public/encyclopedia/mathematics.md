# Mathematics

Mathematics is the study of numbers, patterns, structures, and change. It is the universal language of science, technology, and logic, shaping our understanding of the world.

## History & Evolution

- **Ancient Mathematics:** Babylonian and Egyptian arithmetic, Greek geometry (Euclid), Chinese and Indian advances
- **Medieval:** Islamic Golden Age (al-Khwarizmi, algebra), Fibonacci sequence
- **Renaissance:** Analytic geometry (Descartes), probability theory, calculus (Newton, Leibniz)
- **19th–20th Century:** Non-Euclidean geometry, set theory, abstract algebra, computer science foundations
- **Modern:** Cryptography, chaos theory, mathematical modeling, machine learning

## Notable Mathematicians & Biographies

- **Euclid (c. 300 BCE):** Father of geometry, "Elements"
- **Isaac Newton (1642–1727):** Calculus, laws of motion
- **Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855):** Number theory, statistics, magnetism
- **Emmy Noether (1882–1935):** Abstract algebra, Noether’s theorem
- **Andrew Wiles (b. 1953):** Proved Fermat’s Last Theorem

## Timeline of Major Developments

- **~2000 BCE:** Babylonian and Egyptian mathematics
- **300 BCE:** Euclid’s "Elements"
- **820 CE:** al-Khwarizmi writes on algebra
- **1687:** Newton’s "Principia Mathematica"
- **1830s:** Boole’s logic, foundation of computer science
- **1994:** Wiles proves Fermat’s Last Theorem

## Case Study: The Proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem

For over 350 years, Fermat’s Last Theorem remained unsolved. In 1994, Andrew Wiles proved it, using advanced algebraic geometry and number theory, marking a milestone in mathematical history.
